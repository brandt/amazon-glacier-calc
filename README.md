# The Missing Amazon Glacier Cost-Estimator Calculator

[Go to the calculator][8]

## What
An unofficial, hacked-together cost-estimator for Amazon's new, archival storage service, [Glacier][5].

The calculator is [hosted here][8].

## Why
Amazon hasn't yet provided us with a cost calculator for  [Glacier][5], and figuring out how their [pricing model][6]  translates to real-world use isn't exactly straightforward.

Sometimes the best way to understand something complicated is to interact with it.

This tool helps elucidate the relationship between cost, data retention periods, and recovery scenarios. (See disclaimer below.)

## Who
This version was created by [brandt][1]  
Based on original work by [liangzan][2]  

## How
Built with [AngularJS][3]  
Theme by [orderedlist][4]  

## Disclaimer
This tool was built on quite a few assumptions and estimations. I can't attest to its accuracy. It's neither endorsed nor affiliated with Amazon AWS. The rates are referenced from the [Glacier][6] pricing page and [Glacier FAQ][7].
